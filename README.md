<b>1) Minesweeper: </b>
    Recently, I have developed one small game using Javascript named Minesweeper. I have developed that entire game during my free time. The purpose to develop this game, was to enchance my technical difficulties. 
    
<b>2) WindsAR:</b>
      WindsAR is a mobile application which is developed to increase the revenue of tourism in Windsor city. The purpose of this project is to provide key information about various tourist places to the visitors in an Augmented way. Another primary goal of ‘WindsAR’ is to increase business of local vendors like shops, restaurants, cafes in Windsor and bring new customers to their doorstep.
       My roles and responsibility in this project was to create Django REST APIs for the frontend team. As I already had an experience of front-end experience. So, I took initiative to get the knowledge of API development. I was also helping front-end team during difficulties.
       
<b>3) Crypto Bazaar </b>
      This was a Django web application project. In this project, we have used yFinance API to get live crypto data. I have rendered the data and based on that displayed those data into graphs and displayed predicted crypto prices.
