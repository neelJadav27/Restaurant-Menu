<h2>Work/Project Example</h2>

<b>1) Minesweeper: </b>
    Recently, I had developed a single player game using Javascript which was similar to the popular game Minesweeper. The purpose of this was to enchance my technical skills in game development. This was a good experience for me as a developer because I was able to put my problem solving, critical thinking and analyitical abilities to the test. This application made me realize how important it is to make sure my code is properply commented and highly optimized.   

<b>3)Search Engine</b>
      In this project, I worked with a group of three team members and it was the final project of my Advanced Algorithms and Computing Concepts course. We developed this application using java and as a team leader, I decided which algorithms to use and perosnally worked on developing the web crawler and the data retrival component.
      
<b>2) WindsAR:</b>
      WindsAR is a mobile application that was developed as a team project and its purpose was to increase the revenue of tourism in Windsor city. The purpose of this project was to provide key information about various tourist places to the visitors in an Augmented way.
       My roles and responsibility in this project was to create Django REST APIs for the frontend team. As I already had an experience of front-end development prior to this project, I took initiative to work as a back-end developer as well as helping the front-end team. After completing this project, I got a lot more comfortable as a full stack developer.
       
      

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<b>1) AR Based Project:</b> 
      Recently, I came across one project while using LinkedIn, in which there was a AR based shoes suggestion feature. I have worked in Augemented Reality earlier and always wanted to work more into those projects. That particular project was very inspiring to me because it helps the users to get the idea of new trends in shoes and can also try those just using their mobile device.
      
<b>2) Data Visualization in Javascript</b>
        I read one article at medium.com where it says that there is a release of Data Visualization in Javascript. I think introducing data visualization into the javascript, is a very big step and can render data over the devices very easily. I am planning to use this feature in near future, once it release the official documentation.
     
<b>3) Crypto</b>
     Cryptocurrency is the most popular change in recent years. I've previously taken classes on cryptocurrencies and their architecture. I'd like to learn more about how cryptocurrencies are handled and mined at such a high level. I worked on a project where I was in charge of managing cryptographic data and rendering it on a webpage. I got inspired regarding this project because developing a cryptocurrency requires greatest data structure knowledge and I wanted to learn more about it.
      
      
 <h2>Focus</h2>
 
I read about Critical Mass and learned that it is known for delivering customers with the greatest digital experience possible. If I have an opportunity to
design something at CM, I'm going to try to incorporate augmented reality (AR) into digital advertising strategies. I believe that providing information about the
product in an innovative manner will provide a positive experience for the customer. In terms of innovative marketing ideas, I believe that augmented reality will
be the most effective. During the first month of the project, I will attempt to examine Critical Mass's existing strategies as well as the projects on which the
team is currently engaged. Later, I'll choose the most appropriate project for this functionality. For the next few months, I'd like to concentrate on implementing
this functionality as quickly as possible so that the organisation may obtain the best outcomes from the project.
